# 🎧 Spotify – Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (2025 Project)

A Data Science project that builds a **mood and context-aware hybrid recommender system** using:
- 🎵 Spotify playlist metadata & audio features  
- 📝 Lyrics sentiment (NLP, BERT, LLMs)  
- 💬 Social context signals (Twitter, Reddit)  
- ⚡ Hybrid recommendation strategies (CF + CBF + Context)  
- 📊 Power BI dashboards

## 📌 Project Phases  
**Phase 1: Orientation & Data Understanding**  
✔️ Define scope, literature review, dataset collection  

**Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
✔️ SQL schema, ETL pipeline, sentiment annotation  

**Phase 3: NLP for Mood & Context Extraction**  
✔️ Lyrics mood classification, topic modeling  

**Phase 4: Recommender System Development**  
✔️ CF, CBF, Hybrid models with context awareness  

**Phase 5: Dashboard & Visualization**  
✔️ Power BI dashboard with Spotify-style visuals  

**Phase 6: Finalization & Portfolio Building**  
✔️ Academic report, GitHub polish, LinkedIn showcase
