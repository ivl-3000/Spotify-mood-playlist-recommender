# ðŸŽµ Spotify â€“ Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (2025 Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores how music recommendations can be made more **personalized** by including not only listening history but also the **mood and emotional context** of songs and users.  
We will combine **Spotify playlist data, song lyrics, and social sentiment analysis** to build a **hybrid recommender system** that suggests songs fitting a userâ€™s mood (happy, sad, energetic, calm, etc.).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope

**In-Scope:**
- Collect Spotify playlist metadata (via API or public datasets).
- Collect lyrics and preprocess them for mood/emotion analysis.
- Collect social sentiment data (Twitter/Reddit discussions).
- Apply **NLP/LLMs (BERT, LLaMA)** for mood classification.
- Build a **hybrid recommender system** (collaborative + content-based + mood-aware).
- Store and manage all datasets in **SQL database**.
- Visualize results using a **Power BI dashboard**.
- Document progress on **GitHub + LinkedIn**.

**Out-of-Scope (to keep project realistic for 3 months):**
- Real-time production deployment.
- Large-scale commercial recommender deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

1. **Data Collection & Storage (Phase 1)**
   - Collect raw Spotify playlist, lyrics, and social sentiment data.
   - Define SQL schema and store datasets.

2. **Mood Detection with NLP/LLMs (Phase 2)**
   - Preprocess text (lyrics + posts).
   - Train/fine-tune BERT or LLaMA for mood detection.
   - Assign mood labels (happy, sad, energetic, calm).

3. **Recommender System (Phase 3)**
   - Implement collaborative filtering (userâ€“item).
   - Implement content-based filtering (lyrics/genre similarity).
   - Add mood-aware filtering layer.
   - Build hybrid model and evaluate (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG).

4. **Dashboard & Showcase (Phase 4)**
   - Build a Power BI dashboard for insights & personalization.
   - Document results in GitHub and LinkedIn.
   - Final showcase with report + visuals.
