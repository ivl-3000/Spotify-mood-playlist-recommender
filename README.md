üéµ Spotify ‚Äì Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (2025 Project)
üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build a mood & context-aware music recommender system using Spotify playlists, lyrics, and social sentiment data. By combining NLP (mood detection) with recommender system techniques (collaborative + content-based + hybrid), the goal is to recommend playlists not only based on user preferences but also on mood and emotional context.

üéØ Project Scope

‚úÖ In Scope

Collecting Spotify playlist metadata (songs, artists, albums, genres).

Collecting & preprocessing lyrics data.

Collecting social sentiment data (Twitter/Reddit or dataset).

Storing all data in SQL for structured access.

NLP pipeline for mood/emotion detection from lyrics & posts.

Building a hybrid recommender (collaborative + content-based + mood-aware).

Power BI dashboard for mood trends & recommendations.

Documentation & showcase (GitHub + LinkedIn).

‚ùå Out of Scope

Real-time Spotify app integration.

Production-level deployment.

Multilingual lyric support (focus: English only).

Advanced deep reinforcement learning recommenders.

üéØ Project Objectives

Data Collection & Storage

Gather Spotify playlists, lyrics, and sentiment data.

Store datasets in SQL with a clean schema.

Mood Detection with NLP/LLMs

Preprocess text data (tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords).

Fine-tune BERT/LLaMA models for emotion classification.

Categorize moods: happy, sad, energetic, calm.

Recommender System Development

Implement collaborative filtering (user‚Äìitem).

Implement content-based filtering (lyrics/genre similarity).

Add mood-aware filtering layer.

Combine into hybrid recommender & evaluate with metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG).

Dashboard & Showcase

Build Power BI dashboard (mood trends, recommendations).

Write technical report.

Publish GitHub repo & LinkedIn showcase posts.
