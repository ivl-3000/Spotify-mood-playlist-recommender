# 🎵 Spotify – Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (2025 Project)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to build a **mood & context-aware music recommender system** using **Spotify playlists, lyrics, and social sentiment data**. By combining **NLP (mood detection)** with **recommender system techniques (collaborative + content-based + hybrid)**, the goal is to recommend playlists not only based on user preferences but also on **mood and emotional context**.

## 🎯 Project Scope  

✅ **In Scope**  
- Collecting Spotify playlist metadata (songs, artists, albums, genres).  
- Collecting & preprocessing lyrics data.  
- Collecting social sentiment data (Twitter/Reddit or dataset).  
- Storing all data in SQL for structured access.  
- NLP pipeline for mood/emotion detection from lyrics & posts.  
- Building a hybrid recommender (collaborative + content-based + mood-aware).  
- Power BI dashboard for mood trends & recommendations.  
- Documentation & showcase (GitHub + LinkedIn).  

❌ **Out of Scope**  
- Real-time Spotify app integration.  
- Production-level deployment.  
- Multilingual lyric support (focus: English only).  
- Advanced deep reinforcement learning recommenders.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

1. **Data Collection & Storage**  
   - Gather Spotify playlists, lyrics, and sentiment data.  
   - Store datasets in SQL with a clean schema.  

2. **Mood Detection with NLP/LLMs**  
   - Preprocess text data (tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords).  
   - Fine-tune BERT/LLaMA models for emotion classification.  
   - Categorize moods: *happy, sad, energetic, calm*.  

3. **Recommender System Development**  
   - Implement collaborative filtering (user–item).  
   - Implement content-based filtering (lyrics/genre similarity).  
   - Add mood-aware filtering layer.  
   - Combine into hybrid recommender & evaluate with metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG).  

4. **Dashboard & Showcase**  
   - Build Power BI dashboard (mood trends, recommendations).  
   - Write technical report.  
   - Publish GitHub repo & LinkedIn showcase posts.
