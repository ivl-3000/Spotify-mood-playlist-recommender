# üéµ Spotify ‚Äì Mood & Context-Aware Playlist Recommender (2025 Project)

## üìù Problem Statement
Modern music streaming platforms like Spotify recommend playlists mainly based on user history and collaborative filtering.  
However, user preferences are often influenced by **context and mood** (e.g., studying late at night, working out in the morning, feeling happy/sad, or trending topics on social media).  

**Problem:** Existing recommenders lack true *context awareness*. They fail to dynamically adapt to **when**, **where**, and **how** users listen to music.  

This project aims to design a **Mood & Context-Aware Recommender System** that generates playlists not only based on historical listening data, but also using **mood, time, activity, and social signals**.

## üéØ Approach
The system is built in four phases:

1. **ETL & Data Collection**
   - Collect playlist metadata from Spotify API (tracks, audio features, descriptions).
   - Aggregate user context signals (time of day, activity, device type).
   - Ingest external sources (social media sentiment, trending topics).
   - Store in raw ‚Üí processed ‚Üí feature storage.

2. **NLP for Mood & Context**
   - Sentiment analysis of playlist descriptions and social media text.
   - Emotion/mood classification (happy, sad, energetic, chill).
   - Topic modeling and embeddings (using Hugging Face `transformers` and `sentence-transformers`).
   - Create **mood/context features** for users and tracks.

3. **Recommender System**
   - **Candidate Generation:** nearest neighbors on embeddings, popularity filters, collaborative filtering.
   - **Ranking Model:** context-aware scoring using ML/DL (LightGBM or neural ranker).
   - Evaluate with Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG.

4. **Dashboard & Deployment**
   - **FastAPI** for serving recommendations.
   - **Streamlit** demo app (user selects mood/time ‚Üí system suggests playlist).
   - **Power BI/Tableau** dashboards for analytics (engagement, recommendation performance).
   - Optional cloud deployment on AWS/GCP.
